Should I use Functions component or Classes in TypeScript for MERN & Front-End Projects 🤔
ChatGPT said:
For MERN and Front-End Projects in TypeScript, you should use Function Components instead of Class Components.

✅ Why Choose Function Components in TypeScript?
1️⃣ More Modern & Recommended – Function components are the standard in modern React.
2️⃣ Better Performance – No overhead of class instances, leading to better optimization.
3️⃣ Easier to Read & Maintain – Cleaner syntax with hooks (useState, useEffect).
4️⃣ Better TypeScript Support – Easier to type props, state, and hooks.
5️⃣ Simpler State Management – Hooks replace lifecycle methods (componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate).

🚀 Example: Function Component with TypeScript
tsx
Copy
Edit
import { useState } from "react";

// Define props type
type Props = {
  name: string;
};

const Greeting: React.FC<Props> = ({ name }) => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState<number>(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>
      <p>Clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click Me</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Greeting;
✔️ Uses TypeScript with Hooks (useState)
✔️ Props are strongly typed (Props interface)
✔️ No need for a class, making it more readable

⚠️ When to Use Class Components?
If you're working on an old React project that still uses class components.
If you need Error Boundaries (currently, only class components support them).
💡 Final Answer:
🔥 Use Function Components with Hooks in TypeScript for MERN & Front-End Projects.
💯 More modern, readable, and optimized than Class Components.
